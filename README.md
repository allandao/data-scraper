# Python Web Scraping Project
[allandao.pythonanywhere.com](http://allandao.pythonanywhere.com/)

The goal of this project is to allow a user to paste a url of any RSS feed of any website whitelisted by PythonAnywhere to see the resulting data in a easy to read format. The whitelisted website restriction is due to constraints set by PythonAnywhere's free plan.

An experiment to learn more about building web apps with Python using Flask. Also includes learning Jinja2 syntax and more about git.
